<p> 
IF AI RESEARCHERS,DEVELOPERS,AND DESIGNERS WORKED TO
PROTECT AND RESPECT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHTS ,IT COULD OPEN THE PATH FOR SOCIAL BENEFIT.
TO DISREGARD HUMAN RIGHTS WOULD BE TO CLOSE OFF THAT PATH

    <li><p>Technology companies an researchers should conduct HRIAs throughout the life
        cycle of their AI Systems</p>
    </li>
    
    <li><p>Technology companies should find  effective channels of communication with 
        local civil society groups and researchers</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Government should acknowledge their human rights obligations and incorporate a duty to PROTECT
        fundamental rights in national AI policies,guidelines and possible regulations</p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Since human rights priciples were not written as technical apecifications,human
        rights lawyers,policy makers,social scientists,computer scientists,and engineers should work together to
        operationalize human rights into business models,workflows and product design
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><p> Academics should further examine the value ,limations, and interactions between human
        rights law and human dignity approaches;humanitarian law;and ethics in relation to emerging
        AI technologies.Human rights and legal scholars should work with the other stakeholders on the tradeoffs between rights when
        faced with specific.AI risks and harms.Social science researchers should emprically investigate the on-the-ground impact of AI on human rights
    </p>
    </li>
    <li><p> UN human rights investigators and special reporters should continue researching
        and publicizing the human rights impacts resulting from AI systems.UN officials and
        participating governments should evaluate whether existing UN mechanisms for international 
        rights monitoring,accountability, and redress are adequate to respond to AI and other
        rapidly emerging technologies.UN leadership should also assume a central role in international
        technology debates by promoting shared global values based on fundamental rights and human dignity
